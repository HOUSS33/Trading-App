<!--The alt="{{ top }}" part sets the "alternative text" for the image,
which is what people see if the image can't load or if they're using a screen reader.
The {{ top }} inside the quotes means that whatever text is stored in the top variable will be used as the alt text for the image.
So, if top is "Hello", the alt text for the image will be "Hello".-->

<!--In summary, class="border img-fluid" makes the image have a border
and automatically resize to fit different screen sizes without distorting the image.
Mobile Device: If the screen is narrow, like on a smartphone, the image will scale down to fit the smaller space,still looking sharp and properly proportioned.
Desktop: On a larger screen, the image will expand to fill more space but wonâ€™t stretch beyond its natural size, keeping the image clear and undistorted.-->



<!--What Each Part Does:


-https://api.memegen.link/images/custom/:

This is the base URL for creating a custom meme image.


-{{ top | urlencode }} and {{ bottom | urlencode }}:

These are the words that go on the top and bottom of the meme.
The {{ top }} and {{ bottom }} are placeholders for whatever text you want to appear on the meme.
| urlencode makes sure any special characters (like spaces) in the text are safely included in the URL.



-?background=https://i.imgur.com/CsCgN7Ll.png:

This part tells the API to use a specific image as the background for the meme.
The image is hosted on Imgur, a popular image-sharing site.

-&width=400:

This tells the API to make the final image 400 pixels wide.


Simple Summary:

This code asks the memegen.link API to create a meme with the text you want.
It uses a specific background image and makes sure the image is 400 pixels wide.
The top text goes at the top, and the bottom text goes at the bottom of the meme.
Does that help clarify things? -->
